Most common client is  FileZilla that supports FTP, FTPS and SFTP, but web browsers can also serve as FTP clients. There are several different ways an FTP server and client software can conduct a file transfer using FTP:</p> <ul> <li>Anonymous FTP.\u00a0This is the most basic form of FTP. It provides support for data transfers without encrypting data or using a username and password. It's most commonly used for download of material that is allowed for unrestricted distribution. </li> <li>Password-protected FTP.\u00a0This is also a basic FTP service, but it requires the use of a username and password, though the service might not be encrypted or secure. It also works on port 21.</li> <li>FTP Secure (FTPS) is an extension of FTP that adds security through the use of Transport Layer Security (TLS) or Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption. It provides an additional layer of protection by encrypting the control and data connections, preventing unauthorized access and data interception. FTPS can use either implicit SSL/TLS (FTPIS) or explicit SSL/TLS (FTPS). Implicit FTPS requires SSL/TLS encryption from the start, while explicit FTPS allows the client and server to negotiate encryption after the initial connection. It typically defaults to using port 990.</li> <li>Secure FTP (SFTP) - This is technically not an FTP protocol, but it functions similarly. Rather, SFTP is a subset of the Secure Shell (SSH) protocol that runs over port 22. SSH is commonly used by systems administrators to remotely and securely access systems and applications, and SFTP provides a mechanism within SSH for secure file transfer.</li> </ul> <p>By default, FTP does not encrypt traffic, and individuals can capture packets to read usernames, passwords and other data. By encrypting FTP with FTPS data is protected, limiting the ability of an attacker to eavesdrop on a connection and steal data.</p>"},{"location":"HTTP-HTTPS.html","title":"HTTP/HTTPS","text":""},{"location":"HTTP-HTTPS.html#http","title":"HTTP","text":"<p>Hypertext transfer protocol is a\u00a0protocol\u00a0used for transferring HTML documentations over the internet. It is a client-server protocol, which means requests are initiated by the recipient, usually the Web browser. Clients and servers communicate by exchanging individual messages. The messages sent by the client, usually a Web browser, are called\u00a0requests\u00a0and the messages sent by the server as an answer are called\u00a0responses.</p> <p>To display a Web page, the browser sends an original request to fetch the HTML document that represents the webpage. A server will accept the request and access port 80 which is reserved for HTTP requests and serve the file to the user-agent. The Web browser then combines these resources to present the complete document, the Web page. Scripts executed by the browser can fetch more resources in later phases and the browser updates the Web page accordingly.</p> <p>HTTP is a stateless protocol:</p> <p>HTTP that is the actual transport protocol between the server and the client -- is \"stateless\" because it remembers nothing between invocations.\u00a0EVERY\u00a0resource that is accessed via HTTP is a single request with no threaded connection between them. If you load a web page with an HTML file that within it contains three\u00a0<code>&lt;img&gt;</code>\u00a0tags hitting the same server, there will be four TCP connections negotiated and opened, four data transfers, four connections closed. There is simply no state kept at the server\u00a0at the\u00a0protocol\u00a0level\u00a0that will have the server know anything about you as you come in.</p> <p>Almost anything you want to do other than viewing static web pages will involve sessions and states. When HTTP is used for its original purpose (sharing static information like scientific papers) the stateless protocol makes a lot of sense. When you start using it for things like web applications, online stores, etc. then statelessness starts to be a bother because these are inherently stateful activities. As a result people very rapidly came up with ways to slather state on top of the stateless protocol. These mechanisms have included things like cookies, like encoding state in the URLs and having the server dynamically fire up data based on those, like hidden state requests</p>"},{"location":"HTTP-HTTPS.html#https-hypertext-transfer-protocol-secure","title":"HTTPS - hypertext transfer protocol secure.","text":"<p>The issue with HTTP is that it does not encrypt the packages when a client is communicating with the server.

These addresses are used for different purposes. For example, look at these addresses:</p> <ul> <li> <p>\"Mail From\" address: This identifies the sender and says where to send return notices if any problems occur with the delivery of the message (such as non-delivery notices). The Mail From address appears in the envelope portion of an email message and isn't displayed by your email application, and is sometimes called the 5321.MailFrom address or the reverse-path address. You won't see it unless you examine the headers, but believe me, it's there.</p> </li> <li> <p>\"From\" address: This is the address displayed as the From address by your mail application. The From address identifies the author of the email. That is, the mailbox of the person or system responsible for writing the message. The From address is sometimes called the 5322.From address.</p> </li> </ul> <p>SPF uses a DNS TXT record to list the specific authorized sending IP addresses and services for a domain. Normally, SPF checks only get performed against the 5321.MailFrom address. The 5322.From address (remember, that's the second one) isn't authenticated when you use SPF by itself, which allows for a scenario where a user gets a message that passed SPF checks but has a spoofed 5322.From sender address. </p> <p>This is no fun for anybody, because it's a huge security hole in the phishing and spam realm.</p> <p>The 5321 and 5322 numbers are highly boring geek-speak referring to the Request For Comments (RFC) on these provided by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). If you'd like to tiptoe through the tulips of Internet pain, I leave them here for your reference:</p> <p>https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5321 https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5322</p> <p>Let me give you an example, and in this one the sender addresses are as follows:</p> <p>Mail from address (5321.MailFrom): badguy@phishing.nastyplace.com</p> <p>From address (5322.From): security@yourhappydomain.com</p> <p>If SPF is configured, then the receiving server does a check against the Mail from address badguy@phishing.nastyplace.com. If the message came from a valid source for the domain phishing.nastyplace.com, then the SPF check passes. By \"valid source\", that means that the originating server exists, not that it's actually yours. See the problem already in progress? Since the email client only displays the From address, the user sees this message came from security@yourhappydomain.com. With SPF alone, the validity of yourhappydomain.com was never authenticated.</p> <p>When we use DMARC, the receiving server will additionally perform a check against the From address. In the example above, if there's a DMARC TXT record in place for yourhappydomain.com, then the check against the From address fails because the \"Mail from\" is a mismatch against the legitimate domain.</p> <p>That deceptive email is bounced or quarantined, and the crisis you never knew you had is diverted.</p> <p>Once we've set up SPF and DMARC, we need to set up DKIM. </p> <p>DKIM lets you add a digital signature to email messages in the message header that certify the message in fact originated from your mail server and nowhere else. It's a security measure for your domain specifically, similar to a house or car key, except more cryptographic and messier looking. If you don't set up DKIM and instead allow the mail server to use their default DKIM configuration for your domain, DMARC may fail. This failure can happen because the default DKIM configuration will use the standard nexcess.net domain as the 5321.MailFrom address, not your specific domain. This creates a mismatch between the 5321.MailFrom and the 5322.From addresses in all the email sent from your domain.</p> <p>There are other hairs we could split here that include third-party services, but this is meant to provide an overview of these three records and why they must be intentionally and correctly implemented.</p> <p>If you need to verify or adjust these settings for your own domain or another, I recommend using the DMARCly tool (https://dmarcly.com/tools/), which makes it easy to generate and check your settings.

The authoritative nameserver contains information specific to the domain name it serves (e.g. google.com) and it can provide a recursive resolver with the IP address of that server found in the DNS A record, or if the domain has a CNAME record (alias) it will provide the recursive resolver with an alias domain, at which point the recursive resolver will have to perform a whole new DNS lookup to procure a record from an authoritative nameserver (often an A record containing an IP address). </p> <p>https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/dns-server-types/ </p>"},{"location":"dns.html#dns-records","title":"DNS records","text":""},{"location":"dns.html#a-record","title":"A record","text":"<p>The record that holds the IP address of a domain.

Source port will be a random number between 1024-65535.</li> <li>Destination port will depend on which service we require from the destination machine, and will be provided by the application layer. It will most commonly be one of the well known ports (1-1024).</li> </ul> <p>This process is called segmentation, and said chunks are called segments or datagrams.</p> <p>The receiving system then does the reassembly of these segments - recognizes the incoming packets as one data transmission, reassembles the packets correctly based on the information included in the packets by the sending system and verifies that all the packets for that piece of data arrived in good shape.\u00a0</p> <p>The primary functions of the Transport Layer are:</p> <ul> <li> <p>To enable efficient network transmission, the Transport Layer splits the total amount of data it gets from the applications running at the top layers into smaller units known as segments. The Transport Layer puts these bits back together into the original data stream at the other end.</p> </li> <li> <p>In situations when organised data transfer is required, the Transport Layer creates a connection between the source and the destination. In order to create the proper parameters and guarantee that both systems are prepared to communicate data, a handshake protocol is established. When the data transfer is complete, the Transport Layer closes the connection.</p> </li> <li> <p>The transport layer also assures dependable data transmission. Receiving acknowledgments, or ACK bits, is how this is accomplished. While waiting for the recipient to acknowledge the parts it sent, the sender keeps an eye on them. Any damaged segments are retransmitted by the sender if they receive an acknowledgment.</p> </li> <li> <p>Flow regulation - In order to prevent data overload, transport layer regulates the data transfer rate. </p> </li> <li> <p>Both error detection and repair are handled by the transport layer. Checksums are one of these techniques for error detection. By computing and validating checksums, it can ascertain whether data was tampered with during transmission. The Transport Layer will request retransmission if it finds anything.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Depending on whether the connection favors performance or stability, we differentiate two transport layer protocols: - [[TCP vs UDP]]</p>"},{"location":"internet-models.html#layer-3-network-layer","title":"Layer 3: Network Layer","text":"<p>Because these segments will need to travel all over the Internet along different pathways, we need a mechanism that knows once the segment does arrive, which pathway it's supposed to be sent down to so that it all gets to the final destination.

Most common type is the UTP cable (unshielded twisted pair) which can transmit and receive data, as well as a central box (Hub/Switch) that handles a flow from one machine to another. Each system on a network has a cable connected to the central box.</p> <p>Network Interface Card (NIC) serves as the interface between the PC and the network. Each NIC has a unique identifier with a 48-bit value called media access control address (MAC address) so data is transferred to the right system. No two NICs ever share the same MAC address. Those numbers are provided by Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) to the companies making NICs, which often print the numbers onto the device itself using hexadecimal notation.  - Example: 00\u201340\u201305\u201360\u20137D\u201349</p> <p>First six digits in MAC address represent the number of the NIC manufacturer and they are referred to as Organizationally Unique Identifier (OUI) while the last six digits represent the unique serial number for the NIC and are referred to as device ID. Nomenclature for MAC addresses is also known as MAC-48 and EUI-48 (Extended Unique Identifier, chosen for trademarking purposes).\u00a0</p> <p>NICs transfer the information through the UTP cable in the form of binary data that is broken down into discrete chunks called frames. The NICs create and send, as well as receive and read these frames. Different frames are used on different networks and all NICs on the same network must use the same frame type to communicate with other NICs.</p> <p>(Optional)     Frame begins with the MAC address of the NIC to which the data is to be sent, followed by the MAC address of the sending NIC. Next comes the Types\u00a0field which indicates the type of data transferred, followed by the Data field which contains the encapsulated information. Lastly, there is a special bit of checking information called frame check sequence. FCS uses a type of binary math called cyclic redundancy check (CRC) in order to verify that the data has arrived intact. Most wired connections hold up to 1500 bytes of data.\u00a0</p> <p>When a system sends a frame out on the network, the frame goes into the central box. What happens from that point depends on the type of central box. - Hub could make a copy of the frame and send it to all the connected ports except for the port from which the message originated. Only the NIC to which the frame was addressed would process that frame and the others would drop it when they saw it wasn\u2019t addressed to their MAC addresses. - Switch sent a frame only to the interface associated with the destination of the MAC address.</p> <p>(Optional)     In situations where NIC doesn\u2019t know the MAC address of another NIC, they send a broadcast onto the network to ask for it. If a NIC sends a frame using a broadcast address (MAC address FF-FF-FF-FF-FF-FF), that frame is processed by every single NIC on that network. That broadcast frame\u2019s data will contain a request for a system\u2019s MAC address. Without knowing the MAC address to begin with, the requesting computer will use an IP address to pick the target computer out of the crowd. The system that is sought will read the request in the broadcast frame and respond its MAC address.</p> <p>When the frame finally arrives to the destination machine, the entire process will be reversed. - Data Link will remove the header and a trailer from the frame and pass the packet along to the Network layer. - Network layer will remove the header and pass the packet to the Transport layer. - Transport layer will read the destination port and transfer the frame to the appropriate service in the upper layers.</p> <p>PDU - protocol data unit</p>"},{"location":"internet-models.html#tcpip-model","title":"TCP/IP model","text":"<p>The reason why TCP/IP model has this name is because the persons who developed it focused primarily on these two protocols.
